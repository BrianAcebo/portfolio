# Brian Acebo — Portfolio

Hi, I'm **Brian**. This repo is my personal portfolio site: projects, blog, resume, and a bit about how I work. If you're reviewing this as part of a hiring process, the content below mirrors the [About](https://brianacebo.com/about) page and should give you a clear picture of who I am as an engineer.

## About Me

**Senior Product Engineer · 7+ years**

I'm a product engineer who builds software with a clear focus on outcomes, not just implementation.

My work sits at the intersection of engineering, design, and business. Rather than focusing on a single layer of the stack, I take ownership of products end-to-end — from early concept and user experience, to system architecture, performance, and long-term scalability.

Over the years, I've worked on AI-powered platforms, internal and customer-facing SaaS products, real-time systems, and data-driven applications. This has shaped how I approach development: every technical decision is made with usability, reliability, and real-world impact in mind.

I don't just turn designs into code. I help define how a product should work, why it should work that way, and how it can improve over time.

## How I Work

I approach software as a living system, not a collection of features.

Before writing code, I focus on understanding the problem:

- **Who is this for?**
- **What friction does it remove?**
- **How does it create value?**
- **What happens when it scales?**

From there, I design and build solutions that balance clarity, performance, and maintainability. I use modern tools — including AI-assisted development — to move faster, while maintaining high standards for quality and reliability.

## What I Do

My role often involves:

- Designing user flows and product architecture
- Building robust front-end systems with React and TypeScript
- Backend development with Python and PostgreSQL
- Integrating APIs, AI services, and automation pipelines
- Implementing feature sets like billing, analytics, and operational tooling
- Iterating based on real user behavior and feedback

I care deeply about shipping work that lasts.

---

## What I Believe

Great products aren't created by writing more code — they're created by making better decisions.

I believe strong engineers should:

- Think in systems, not tickets
- Take responsibility for outcomes
- Communicate clearly with technical and non-technical teams
- Build with the future in mind
- Continuously improve their craft

Technology changes quickly, but these principles don't.

---

## Today

Today, I focus on building scalable, AI-enabled products that help businesses operate more efficiently and serve their customers better.

Whether I'm working on a startup, a growing SaaS platform, or a complex internal system, my goal is always the same: build thoughtful software that solves real problems and creates measurable impact.

If you're looking for someone who can move from idea to execution — and take responsibility for everything in between — I'd love to connect.

## About This Project

This portfolio is a **React (Vite) + TypeScript** front end with a **FastAPI (Python)** backend for projects, blog, and search. It’s meant to reflect how I build: clear structure, responsive UI, and attention to UX.

**Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router 7, Lucide icons, Framer Motion · FastAPI, Python 3

**Run locally:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start frontend + API (dev)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

The API serves project data, blog posts, and search from `api/`; see `api/README.md` for API details.
